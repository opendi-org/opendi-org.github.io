Computer scientist [Dr. Lorien Pratt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorien_Pratt) is one of the pioneers of artificial intelligence and is credited with inventing transfer learning. Following a 38-year career delivering applied AI systems, along with leadership and program committee responsibilities at the industry-leading NeurIPS conference, Pratt is recognized alongside Marie Curie and others by the Women Innovators and Inventors Project. Today, Pratt is chief scientist at www.quantellia.com, where she continues to push the boundaries of technology as a creator of and evangelist for Decision Intelligence (DI), a cofounder of the Open Decision Intelligence Initiative, and by providing Large Language Models (LLMs)  with [Compact World Models](https://www.lorienpratt.com/cwms-for-agentic-ai) (DI Decision Models) to build Agentic AI applications.  Pratt’s [The Decision Intelligence Handbook](https://www.dihandbook.com/) (O’Reilly, 2023) is receiving worldwide attention. With recent publications in Foresight, Futures, and Frontiers, Pratt's DI innovations connect AI to human decision making in a way that is transparent, auditable, and accessible, bringing this important technology to the masses, and reducing information inequality.

Dr. David L. Roberts is the Assistant Director of Undergraduate Programs and an
Associate Professor of Computer Science, North Carolina State University. He
has a particular focus on computation as a tool to provide insight into human
and nonhuman animal behavior in narrative, virtual world, and game
environments. His laboratory regularly works with leading non-profit service
animal and animal welfare organizations to bring the power of algorithms and
analytics to bear on the challenging problems of understanding (human and
non-human) animal behavior.  His research interests lie at the intersection of
machine learning, social and behavioral psychology, and human–computer
interaction. Roberts regularly works in collaboration with faculty and
industry representatives from fields outside Computer Science, particularly in
the veterinary and agricultural sciences.

He is a co-founder of the Open Decision Intelligence (OpenDI)
Initiative. The OpenDI Initiative is providing the industry standard software
reference architecture for DI technology and service providers to promote
interoperability, democratized access, and support diverse representation in
the DI technology and service verticals. Both in his research at NCSU and in
several startups, Roberts has directed several deployed enterprise software and
hardware projects that enable real world data collection and research. He has
extensive experience with user-centered design, Agile software methodology, and
decision augmentation using data and AI.
